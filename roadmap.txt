Phase 1: I'll make my own Zorklike -- with Blackjack!

Tools needed:
    User input in => 
            readline
            parsing/validation (match input with command)
    Internal Game state Representation =>
            'Card' object/class
                    Shuffle, Deal, Compare, Sum
            Deck/Discard Pile/Hand objects?
    User Information Display out =>
            Game State
            Command Options
                    game commands, ui commands
            Result of input parsing
                    errors, game state changes
    Persistence
            Ability to save/load game state to/from a file
    


Step1:
    Make a simple game loop:
        display welcome text
        loop:
        calls "play game" function
            creates 'sum' 0
            displays sum, asks hit or stand
            reads text from user until matches valid command
            executes command:
                hit: gen random number 1-10, add it to sum
                    if sum > 21, game over
                stand: game over
        when game over, asks user play again/quit.
        If play again, restart loop.
        If not, display goodbye text
